		    The website serves to display the photos of bicycles in work environments and therefore, the photos are organized in albums. The site provides access to all albums on the homepage. Each album is presented as a row in a grid with some photos already shown and the user must click left and right to browse more photos. Each row consists of an album and as the user scrolls down, more albums keep appearing to give the idea of an endless collection of photos. The minimal effort it takes to browse photos (users do not have to click any other pages to do what they have come to the site to do) indicates that it is a very functional website.

		    The navigation is very clear on the site. There are four buttons in the upper right corner directing the user to whatever information they need. However, since the main content of the site are photos of work cyclists, the album navigation provided and "endless page" scrolling allows the user to remain on the homepage for most of their needs. Therefore, the navigation is simple and very effective.

However, past that, the site showcases the architect's works effectively.

However, upon clicking a piece of work, the images are not centered and there is very little information about the work. Other information on the other pages is simply and clearly stated.
